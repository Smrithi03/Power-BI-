# Power-BI-
Here's a COVID-19 dashboard providing an overview and insights into the data. The COVID-19 dashboard I am referring to is a comprehensive tool that provides a detailed overview and insights into the spread and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The dashboard has been designed as part of a Power BI project by UNP Education, and it offers data about the virus's global spread, including the number of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries. In addition, the dashboard allows users to explore data by country, providing an understanding of the pandemic's impact on specific locations. The dashboard is a valuable resource for policymakers, public health officials, and individuals who are interested in monitoring and understanding the COVID-19 pandemic.
